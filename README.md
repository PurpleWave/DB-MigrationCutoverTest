# API Cutover Test Run ‚Äì Production (Read-Only / GET Endpoints)

This repository supports the validation of modernized API services during the **production cutover phase**, focusing strictly on **read-only (`GET`) endpoints**. The goal is to ensure that the APIs respond correctly and consistently in the live environment without modifying any data.

## üìå Purpose

- Validate that all **modernized service endpoints** function as expected during the database migration period.
- Provide the **QA team** with a ready-to-use test collection for running **comprehensive regression tests** in **read-only mode**.
- Confirm the correctness of API behavior, response schemas, and performance in a production-like setting.
